## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- That SVG filters are annoying to adapt. I hope someone can point me in the right direction to fix putting it in the HTML. I gave up after about an hour of googling and trying different methods.
- That autocompletion defaults to the browsers styling. Which is nice for usability, but kind of ugly too. And hard to fix with CSS.
- Having the Figma files for a challenge helps getting it more pixel perfect, which is nice. It's fun to play around with that, I know it is not the most important. It also is nice to see how the Figma files are structured by a real designer and that my methods come quite close.
- I should not commit everything in one go. I'm off to write that sentence on a chalkboard somewhere a 1000 times.

### Continued development

- [ ] Fix SVG properly, not by dumping it like this in the HTML
- [ ] Add styling when autocompleting an email address

### Useful resources

- [Hex to colorfilter](https://codepen.io/brucebentley/pen/orGPRg) - This helped me to create the filters for the icons. I struggled a bit getting it working.
